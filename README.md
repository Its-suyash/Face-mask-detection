**Face-Mask-Detection**

Face Mask Detection System built with OpenCV, TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in real-time video streams.
This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.
